# DLR

DLR is short for Dealer. This app is a random pool holder that allows you to create users and pools which they can be in that can be though of as markets almost. Every 24 hours there is a set time for their to be a "roll" and it is decided if that 'pool' crashes or not. Do not since this was a hackathon, some of the things that we wanted to get done with the Front end web side did not happen. I will link to the IOS app that pairs with the application as well.
